- Final verification before releases

### 2. Automated Testing

- Daily smoke tests on the development environment
- Full regression suite before each release
- Critical path tests after production deployment
- Scheduled overnight runs for comprehensive tests

### 3. Testing Schedule

| Test Type | Frequency | Environment | Trigger |
|-----------|-----------|-------------|---------|
| Smoke Tests | Daily | Development | Automated (scheduled) |
| Critical Path Tests | On merge to main | Staging | Automated (on commit) |
| Full Regression | Pre-release | Staging | Automated (on release branch) |
| Post-deployment Verification | After release | Production | Automated (post-deploy) |

2. Create game data tests
3. Add player comparison tests
4. Implement dashboard tests

### Phase 3: Complex Scenarios and PWA Testing

1. Create end-to-end user journeys
2. Implement PWA-specific tests
3. Add visual regression tests
4. Implement accessibility tests

### Phase 4: Mobile Testing and Refinement

4. Create comprehensive test documentation

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Flaky tests | High | Medium | Implement retry mechanisms, isolate test data, add detailed logging |
| Slow test execution | Medium | High | Implement parallel execution, optimize test efficiency, use selective testing |
| Inadequate coverage | High | Medium | Use coverage analysis tools, perform gap analysis, prioritize critical flows |
| Environment instability | High | Medium | Use containerized environments, implement health checks, add environment monitoring |
| Test maintenance burden | Medium | High | Use page objects, shared utilities, and maintainable patterns |

## Success Criteria

1. 90% or higher pass rate for all automated tests
2. 95% or higher coverage of critical user journeys
3. All critical features covered by automated tests
4. Test execution time under 30 minutes for full suite
5. Visual regression tests for all key components

    cy.get('[data-cy="confirm-password-input"]').type('SecurePassword123!');
    cy.get('[data-cy="register-submit"]').click();
    
    // Verify registration success
    cy.get('[data-cy="verification-message"]').should('be.visible');
    cy.contains('Please verify your email address').should('be.visible');
  });

  it('Should allow a user to login with email and password', () => {
    cy.get('[data-cy="login-button"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-cy="email-input"]').type('existing@example.com');
    cy.get('[data-cy="password-input"]').type('ExistingPassword123!');
    cy.get('[data-cy="login-submit"]').click();
    
    // Verify login success
    cy.get('[data-cy="user-menu"]').should('be.visible');
    cy.contains('Dashboard').should('be.visible');
  });
});
```

### Player Stats Test Example

```javascript
describe('Player Statistics', () => {
  beforeEach(() => {
    cy.login('testuser@example.com', 'password123');
    cy.visit('/players');
  });

  it('Should allow filtering players by team', () => {
    cy.get('[data-cy="filter-button"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-cy="team-select"]').click();
    cy.contains('Los Angeles Lakers').click();
    cy.get('[data-cy="apply-filters"]').click();
    
    // Verify only Lakers players are shown
    cy.get('[data-cy="player-card"]').each(($card) => {
      cy.wrap($card).find('[data-cy="player-team"]').should('contain', 'Lakers');
    });
  });

  it('Should display correct player details when a player is selected', () => {
    cy.contains('LeBron James').click();
    
    // Verify player details page
    cy.url().should('include', '/players/');
    cy.get('[data-cy="player-name"]').should('contain', 'LeBron James');
    cy.get('[data-cy="player-stats"]').should('be.visible');
