## Demonstration Tips

- **Rehearse thoroughly**: Complete at least one full rehearsal before the actual demonstration
- **Prepare for issues**: Have backup plans for potential technical difficulties
- **Know your audience**: Tailor technical depth to the audience's knowledge
- **Stay on schedule**: Assign a timekeeper to ensure the demo stays on track
- **Record the session**: Capture the demonstration for documentation and future reference

## Backup Plan

If any feature fails during the live demonstration:
1. Switch to pre-recorded video for that specific feature
2. Acknowledge the issue and explain the normal functionality
3. Continue with the next demonstration item
4. Document the issue for follow-up

## Post-Demonstration Activities

- [ ] Compile all questions and answers from the session
- [ ] Document any identified issues or enhancements
- [ ] Update project documentation based on feedback
- [ ] Schedule follow-up meetings for any open items
- [ ] Finalize production deployment preparations

## Demonstration Environment Verification

Before starting the demonstration, run the environment verification script:

```bash
python scripts/verify_environment.py --output docs/demo_verification_report.md
```

Only proceed with the demonstration if the verification passes with at least 95% success rate.
