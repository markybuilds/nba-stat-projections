# Cursor Rules

This file defines rules and settings for the Cursor IDE when working with this project.

## Memory Bank

The memory-bank/ directory contains critical project documentation that must be maintained.
All task tracking should be done in memory-bank/tasks.md.
All completed tasks should be archived in docs/archive/completed_tasks.md.

## Adaptive Workflow Process

Follow these workflows based on task complexity:

### Level 1: Quick Bug Fix
INITIALIZATION → IMPLEMENTATION → DOCUMENTATION

### Level 2: Simple Enhancement
INITIALIZATION → DOCUMENTATION → PLANNING → IMPLEMENTATION → REFLECTION → ARCHIVING

### Level 3-4: Complex Features/Systems
Full 6-step workflow with comprehensive documentation

## Command Safety

Execute commands ONE AT A TIME, never chained.
Always verify directory structure exists before operating on files.
