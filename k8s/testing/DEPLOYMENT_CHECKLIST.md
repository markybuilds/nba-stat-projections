# Production Deployment Checklist

This document provides a comprehensive checklist for deploying the monitoring test resources to the production environment.

## Pre-Deployment Preparation

### Environment Verification
- [ ] Verify Kubernetes cluster access with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Confirm Prometheus is deployed and accessible
- [ ] Verify Alertmanager is correctly configured
- [ ] Ensure database server is accessible from the Kubernetes cluster
- [ ] Check available cluster resources (CPU, memory, storage)
- [ ] Verify network connectivity between components
- [ ] Confirm firewall rules allow required traffic

### Resource Preparation
- [ ] Review all Kubernetes manifests for production readiness
- [ ] Update image references to use production-ready versions
- [ ] Set appropriate resource limits and requests
- [ ] Verify all ConfigMaps and Secrets are properly configured
- [ ] Check that all required namespaces exist or can be created
- [ ] Ensure all required service accounts have proper permissions
- [ ] Validate network policies for appropriate restrictions

### Documentation Review
- [ ] Review Production Deployment Guide for accuracy
- [ ] Verify all commands and examples are correct
- [ ] Check that all prerequisites are clearly documented
- [ ] Ensure troubleshooting guidance is comprehensive
- [ ] Update contact information and escalation paths if needed
- [ ] Verify alerts are configured with appropriate thresholds

## Deployment Process

### Namespace and RBAC Setup
- [ ] Create `monitoring-tests` namespace
- [ ] Apply appropriate labels and annotations
- [ ] Create required service accounts
- [ ] Configure role-based access control
- [ ] Verify permissions are properly applied

### Core Component Deployment
- [ ] Deploy error endpoint resources
- [ ] Deploy slow response endpoint resources
- [ ] Deploy memory usage test resources
- [ ] Deploy CPU usage test resources
- [ ] Deploy database test resources
- [ ] Verify all pods are running correctly
- [ ] Check that services are correctly exposed

### Database Configuration
- [ ] Create production test database (or schema)
- [ ] Create database user with appropriate permissions
- [ ] Apply initial database schema and test data
- [ ] Create ConfigMap with database connection information
- [ ] Create Secret with database credentials
- [ ] Verify database connectivity from test resources
- [ ] Test slow query execution

### Monitoring Integration
- [ ] Update Prometheus scraping configuration
- [ ] Apply monitoring test alert rules
- [ ] Configure Alertmanager routing for test alerts
- [ ] Create or update alert notification channels
- [ ] Verify metrics are being scraped correctly
- [ ] Test alert triggering and notification delivery

### Scheduled Testing Setup
- [ ] Create CronJob for regular test execution
- [ ] Set appropriate schedule for off-peak hours
- [ ] Configure notification for test results
- [ ] Apply resource limits to scheduled tests
- [ ] Set up logging for test execution
- [ ] Verify CronJob permissions and configuration

## Post-Deployment Verification

### Functional Testing
- [ ] Manually trigger each test category
- [ ] Verify metrics are being collected
- [ ] Confirm alerts trigger when thresholds are exceeded
- [ ] Validate notification delivery
- [ ] Stop tests and verify alerts resolve
- [ ] Check test resource cleanup

### Security Verification
- [ ] Validate network policy restrictions
- [ ] Verify secure secrets handling
- [ ] Check that test resources are properly isolated
- [ ] Confirm alert labels prevent confusion with real alerts
- [ ] Verify proper use of service accounts and RBAC
- [ ] Check that database credentials are properly secured

### Documentation Finalization
- [ ] Document final production configuration
- [ ] Update any differences from deployment guide
- [ ] Record environment-specific settings
- [ ] Document verification results
- [ ] Update contact information if needed

### Operational Readiness
- [ ] Verify operations team has access to all resources
- [ ] Confirm monitoring team can see test alerts
- [ ] Check that scheduled tests run correctly
- [ ] Validate log collection and retention
- [ ] Test troubleshooting procedures
- [ ] Complete handover documentation with production-specific details

## Final Checklist

### Test Execution
- [ ] Execute full end-to-end test for each category
  - [ ] Error rate test
  - [ ] Slow response test
  - [ ] Memory usage test
  - [ ] CPU usage test
  - [ ] Database performance test
- [ ] Verify all alerts trigger correctly
- [ ] Confirm all notifications are delivered
- [ ] Check that alert resolution works as expected

### Stakeholder Sign-Off
- [ ] Operations team sign-off
- [ ] Monitoring team sign-off
- [ ] Security team sign-off (if applicable)
- [ ] Database administration team sign-off (if applicable)
- [ ] Project management sign-off

### Documentation and Knowledge Transfer
- [ ] Schedule formal handover session
- [ ] Distribute production-specific documentation
- [ ] Complete knowledge transfer to operations team
- [ ] Collect and address feedback
- [ ] Archive deployment documentation

## Rollback Plan

In case of deployment issues, follow these steps:

1. **Issue Identification**
   - [ ] Document the specific issue encountered
   - [ ] Determine impact severity
   - [ ] Notify stakeholders of the issue

2. **Immediate Mitigation**
   - [ ] Stop any running tests
   - [ ] Disable scheduled tests (CronJob)
   - [ ] Pause alert notifications if needed

3. **Resource Cleanup**
   - [ ] Delete problematic resources
   - [ ] Clean up any partially created resources
   - [ ] Verify system stability

4. **Root Cause Analysis**
   - [ ] Determine cause of deployment issue
   - [ ] Document findings
   - [ ] Update deployment process to prevent recurrence

5. **Re-Deployment Planning**
   - [ ] Correct issues in deployment manifests
   - [ ] Update documentation
   - [ ] Schedule new deployment window
   - [ ] Obtain approvals for re-deployment
