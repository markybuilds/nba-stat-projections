# Test Execution Log

## Overview
This document tracks the execution and results of monitoring test validation for the NBA Stats Projections system.

## Test Environment
- Windows 10 (Local Development)
- Kubernetes Cluster (Production-like)
- Prometheus and Alertmanager configured
- Database connection established

## Test Execution Results

### 1. Error Generation Tests
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- ✅ Error endpoint deployment
- ✅ Error rate validation - Endpoint returning 500 status as expected
- ✅ Alert trigger verification
- ✅ Notification delivery check

### 2. Slow Response Tests
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- ✅ Slow endpoint deployment
- ✅ Response time validation - Response time exceeding 1-second threshold
- ✅ Alert trigger verification
- ✅ Notification delivery check

### 3. Memory Usage Tests
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- ✅ Memory test deployment
- ✅ Resource consumption validation - Memory usage above 100MB threshold
- ✅ Alert trigger verification
- ✅ Notification delivery check

### 4. CPU Usage Tests
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- ✅ CPU test deployment
- ✅ Resource utilization validation - CPU usage above 50% threshold
- ✅ Alert trigger verification
- ✅ Notification delivery check

### 5. Database Performance Tests
**Status**: ✅ Completed
- ✅ Database environment configuration tool created (`configure-database.cmd`)
- ✅ Database connectivity verification
- ✅ Test table creation
- ✅ Slow query execution validation
- ✅ Alert trigger verification
- ✅ Updated validation script with comprehensive database environment checks

## Issues and Findings
1. Database Test Configuration
   - ✅ Created interactive database configuration tool for automated setup
   - ✅ Implemented comprehensive environment variable checks in validation script
   - ✅ Added test table creation utilities for simplified testing
   - ✅ Implemented more robust connectivity tests

2. Test Performance
   - Error generation functioning as expected
   - Slow response simulation meeting thresholds
   - Memory and CPU tests showing proper resource utilization
   - Alert triggers functioning correctly for all tests
   - Database slow query tests functioning correctly

## Performance Metrics
1. Error Tests
   - Target: 500 status code
   - Result: Achieved consistently

2. Slow Response Tests
   - Target: >1 second response time
   - Result: Consistently exceeding threshold

3. Memory Tests
   - Target: >100MB usage
   - Result: Successfully consuming expected resources

4. CPU Tests
   - Target: >50% utilization
   - Result: Meeting CPU load requirements
   
5. Database Tests
   - Target: >1 second query time
   - Result: Consistently achieving 2+ second query times
   - Sample query: `WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:02'; SELECT 1;`
   - Complex query: Table scan with 10,000 iterations

## Validation Summary
- 5 out of 5 test categories completed successfully
- Database configuration tool created for simplified setup
- Validation script enhanced with better error detection
- Alert triggers verified for all tests
- Resource utilization within expected parameters
- Created comprehensive documentation for database configuration

## Next Steps
1. Final Verification
   - Deploy database configuration in production environment
   - Verify database alert triggers in production
   - Document production environment configuration
   - Complete sign-off process with stakeholders

2. Knowledge Transfer
   - Schedule team demonstration
   - Review all documentation with monitoring team
   - Train operations team on test execution
   - Complete handover package
