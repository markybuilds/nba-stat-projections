# Demonstration Environment Preparation Checklist

## Overview
This checklist outlines all the tasks required to prepare the demonstration environment for the Team Demonstration and Knowledge Transfer session. The environment must be fully functional to demonstrate all monitoring test resources, including error generation, slow responses, memory/CPU utilization, and database performance testing.

## Environment Setup

### Kubernetes Environment
- [ ] Ensure demonstration cluster is operational
- [ ] Verify namespace `monitoring-test-demo` exists
- [ ] Check RBAC permissions are correctly configured
- [ ] Validate network policies allow proper access
- [ ] Confirm Prometheus is scraping metrics from the namespace
- [ ] Verify Alertmanager is properly configured
- [ ] Test Grafana dashboard access and functionality

### Windows Test Environment
- [ ] Prepare Windows test machine with necessary tools
- [ ] Install required dependencies (curl, PowerShell modules)
- [ ] Copy all Windows scripts to demonstration environment
- [ ] Verify Windows scripts have proper execution permissions
- [ ] Test database connectivity from Windows environment
- [ ] Ensure Kubernetes access is configured from Windows machine
- [ ] Check network connectivity to all required services

### Database Environment
- [ ] Verify database server is accessible
- [ ] Confirm test database is configured
- [ ] Check user permissions for database operations
- [ ] Test database connectivity from all environments
- [ ] Prepare test tables with sample data
- [ ] Validate slow query functionality
- [ ] Ensure monitoring is configured for database metrics

## Test Resources Deployment

### Core Resources
- [ ] Deploy error endpoint test resources
- [ ] Deploy slow response test resources
- [ ] Deploy memory usage test resources
- [ ] Deploy CPU utilization test resources
- [ ] Verify all pods are running correctly
- [ ] Test resource connectivity
- [ ] Validate all services are properly exposed

### Configuration
- [ ] Set up environment variables for all test resources
- [ ] Configure test thresholds and parameters
- [ ] Set up alert rules with demonstration thresholds
- [ ] Configure test frequencies and durations
- [ ] Prepare demonstration-specific configurations
- [ ] Document all configuration values used for demo
- [ ] Create configuration backup for quick reset

## Validation Testing

### Functionality Testing
- [ ] Run `validate-tests.cmd all` to verify all tests work
- [ ] Check error generation functionality
- [ ] Test slow response simulation
- [ ] Validate memory usage test
- [ ] Verify CPU utilization test
- [ ] Test database performance monitoring
- [ ] Verify control scripts functionality

### Alert Validation
- [ ] Trigger each alert type manually
- [ ] Verify alerts appear in Alertmanager
- [ ] Check alert notification channels
- [ ] Test alert resolution
- [ ] Validate alert thresholds
- [ ] Document alert testing results
- [ ] Reset alert state for demonstration

## Presentation Materials

### Technical Setup
- [ ] Prepare demonstration machine with proper screen resolution
- [ ] Set up screen sharing software
- [ ] Test audio and video quality
- [ ] Configure multiple monitors if needed
- [ ] Prepare backup presentation method
- [ ] Test recording functionality
- [ ] Verify all participants can see shared screens

### Documentation
- [ ] Make documentation easily accessible during demo
- [ ] Prepare quick reference sheet for commands
- [ ] Create step-by-step demonstration script
- [ ] Highlight key points for each test resource
- [ ] Prepare troubleshooting guide for common issues
- [ ] Create diagram of system architecture
- [ ] Have links to all resources ready to share

## Hands-On Exercise Preparation

### Participant Access
- [ ] Create temporary credentials for participants
- [ ] Set up read-only access to demonstration environment
- [ ] Configure access control for hands-on portion
- [ ] Test participant login process
- [ ] Prepare backup access method if needed
- [ ] Document access instructions for participants
- [ ] Create access verification process

### Exercise Materials
- [ ] Create step-by-step exercise guides
- [ ] Prepare exercise scenarios for each test type
- [ ] Set up sample environment for exercises
- [ ] Test all exercise steps
- [ ] Prepare solution guide for exercises
- [ ] Create reset procedure for exercise environment
- [ ] Develop verification steps for exercise completion

## Final Checks

### Pre-Demonstration
- [ ] Run full system validation 24 hours before demo
- [ ] Verify all alerts are in expected state
- [ ] Check all pods and services are running
- [ ] Test all demonstration scenarios end-to-end
- [ ] Ensure monitoring dashboards are accessible
- [ ] Confirm all team members have access
- [ ] Test internet connectivity and VPN access

### Backup Plans
- [ ] Prepare backup demonstration environment
- [ ] Create alternative demonstration procedures
- [ ] Have backup presenter identified
- [ ] Document fallback options for each demo component
- [ ] Prepare offline documentation in case of connectivity issues
- [ ] Have backup communication channel established
- [ ] Create contingency plans for technical failures

## Reset Procedures
- [ ] Document environment reset procedures
- [ ] Create automated reset scripts
- [ ] Test reset process
- [ ] Verify environment state after reset
- [ ] Document known issues and workarounds
- [ ] Prepare rollback procedures
- [ ] Test restoration from backup
