## Archival Process

### 1. Documentation Collection

Gather all project documentation for archival:

- [x] Project charter and initial requirements
- [x] Technical design documents
- [x] Implementation documentation
- [x] Testing and validation results
- [x] Deployment guides
- [x] Knowledge transfer materials
- [x] Sign-off documents
- [x] Project completion certificate

### 2. Source Code Repository

- [ ] Create a final release tag in the repository
- [ ] Generate a comprehensive README for the final version
- [ ] Ensure all code is properly documented
- [ ] Archive a copy of the repository
- [ ] Update repository access permissions if needed

### 3. Digital Archive

- [ ] Create a dedicated archive folder in the organization's document management system
- [ ] Organize files in a logical structure:
  ```
  /Archive/Monitoring-Test-Resources-2025/

  │   ├── Charter/
  │   ├── Plans/
  │   ├── Status-Reports/
  │   └── Sign-Off/
  ├── 02-Technical-Documentation/
  │   ├── Design/
  │   ├── Implementation/
  │   ├── Testing/
  │   └── Deployment/
  ├── 03-Knowledge-Transfer/
  │   ├── Presentations/
  │   ├── Training-Materials/
  │   └── Handover-Documents/
  ├── 04-Source-Code/
  │   ├── Final-Release/
  │   └── README.md
  └── 05-Completion/
      ├── Certificate/
      ├── Lessons-Learned/
      └── Future-Enhancements/
  ```
- [ ] Create an archive index document listing all archived files
