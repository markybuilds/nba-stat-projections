## Technical Implementation Details

### Backend Architecture

The backend is built with FastAPI and follows a layered architecture:

1. **API Layer**: Contains route definitions and endpoint handlers
2. **Service Layer**: Contains business logic and projection algorithms
3. **Repository Layer**: Handles database interactions
4. **Data Layer**: Defines data models and schemas

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend uses Next.js with the App Router and follows these principles:

1. **Server Components**: For initial data loading and SEO
2. **Client Components**: For interactive features
3. **Hooks**: For state management and API interactions
4. **UI Components**: For consistent design

### Real-time Updates Architecture

The real-time updates system consists of:

1. **WebSocket Server**: FastAPI WebSocket endpoint with connection manager
2. **Notification System**: For broadcasting updates to connected clients
3. **WebSocket Client**: TypeScript client with reconnection logic
4. **Context Provider**: React context for application-wide WebSocket access
5. **Custom Hooks**: For consuming real-time data in components
6. **Toast Notifications**: For alerting users to updates

### Data Automation Architecture

The data automation system consists of:

1. **Scheduler Service**: Using APScheduler for managing scheduled tasks
2. **CLI Tool**: For administrators to manage scheduled tasks
3. **Daily Update Script**: Refreshes game and projection data with error handling
4. **Kubernetes CronJob**: For running the scheduler in production
5. **Health Check Endpoint**: For monitoring scheduler status
6. **Metrics Tracking**: For performance and execution monitoring
7. **Alerting System**: For notification of failures or issues

### Monitoring and Alerting Architecture

The monitoring and alerting system consists of:

1. **Metrics Service**: For collecting and exposing Prometheus metrics
2. **Prometheus Integration**: For storing and querying metrics
3. **Alerting Service**: For evaluating alert conditions and sending notifications
4. **Alert Endpoints**: API endpoints for viewing and managing alerts
5. **Email Notifications**: For critical alerts
6. **Slack Integration**: For team notifications
7. **Health Checks**: Proactive monitoring of system components

### Database Schema

The database uses Supabase (PostgreSQL) with the following tables:
- Teams
- Players
- Games
- Player_Stats
- Projections

### API Endpoints

- `/teams`: Team data operations
- `/players`: Player data operations
- `/games`: Game data operations
- `/projections`: Projection operations
- `/ws`: WebSocket endpoint for real-time updates
- `/api/v1/alerts`: Alerts management endpoints
- `/metrics`: Prometheus metrics endpoint
- `/healthz`: Health check endpoint

## Next Steps

1. Optimize performance for production
2. Implement user authentication for admin features
3. Add more advanced filtering options
4. Deploy to production environment
5. Add analytics tracking
6. Create alerting dashboard UI
7. Set up Grafana dashboards for metrics visualization
