The projection algorithm currently uses a weighted moving average that gives more importance to recent games and applies adjustments for home court advantage. We've successfully tested this with real NBA player data (LeBron James, Giannis Antetokounmpo, etc.) and the results are encouraging, producing reasonable projections for key stats like points, assists, and rebounds.

The API endpoints provide functionality for:
- Getting players with available projections
- Getting games with projections (including date filtering)
- Getting projections for specific players or games
- Getting projections for today's games

We've successfully initialized the Supabase database with our schema, including:
- Created all tables (teams, players, games, player_stats, player_projections)
- Set up triggers for automatically updating timestamps
- Created indexes for optimizing query performance
- Created views for today's games and projections
- Tested database operations for teams, players, and games
- Fixed the Player model to match the database schema
- Updated date/time handling in models to ensure proper JSON serialization

We've also successfully tested the NBA API integration by:
- Retrieving information about teams, players, and games
- Processing player game logs into our format
- Verifying rate limiting functionality to prevent throttling
- Testing with real NBA player IDs to ensure data quality
- Storing retrieved data in the database

The frontend now provides a comprehensive user interface with:
- Dashboard view showing today's games and projections
- Players listing with search functionality
- Detailed player profiles with projection information
- Games listing with date filtering
- Detailed game pages with team and player projections
- Projections overview with filtering options
