   - Created reusable PullToRefresh hook (use-pull-to-refresh.ts) for detecting pull gestures
   - Built a wrapper component (PullToRefresh.tsx) that can be applied to any content
   - Added refresh capabilities to real-time hooks (useRealTimeGames, useRealTimeProjections)
   - Integrated pull-to-refresh on Dashboard, Games, and Projections pages
   - Implemented visual feedback with progress indicator and toast notifications
   - Added fallback refresh buttons for desktop users or accessibility

2. **Implemented Cloudflare CDN integration**
   - Configured Cloudflare account and rules
   - Set up caching for static assets
   - Implemented SSL certificates

3. **Added custom image loaders**
   - Optimized image delivery pipeline
   - Implemented progressive loading
   - Added responsive image sizing

4. **Implemented performance monitoring**
   - Added real-time performance metrics
   - Set up alerting for performance degradation
   - Created performance dashboards

5. **Created notification system**
   - Implemented real-time game notifications
   - Added subscription management
   - Created notification preference controls

## Technical Decisions

1. **Mobile User Experience**
   - Using card-based layouts instead of tables for mobile view
   - Implementing touch-friendly interactions with larger tap targets
   - Creating mobile-specific navigation with hamburger menu
   - Using pull-to-refresh for data updates to match native mobile app patterns
   - Setting appropriate throttling (500ms) for refresh operations to prevent rapid repeated calls

2. **Component Library**
   - Using shadcn/ui for the component library
   - Customizing components to match NBA theme
   - Creating specialized components for player and team display

3. **Data Tables**
   - Building custom responsive data tables for desktop
   - Implementing card-based alternatives for mobile
   - Using virtualized lists for large datasets

4. **Styling**
   - Using Tailwind CSS for styling
   - Implementing dark mode support
   - Creating consistent spacing and typography system

## Open Questions

1. **Mobile Layout Differences**
   - How significantly should mobile layouts differ from desktop?
   - Should we maintain feature parity or simplify for mobile?

2. **Data Table Display on Mobile**
   - What's the best approach for showing large data tables on mobile?
   - How to handle many columns in a responsive way?

3. **Touch Interaction Optimization**
   - What additional touch interactions would improve the mobile experience?
   - How to balance gestures with discoverability?
