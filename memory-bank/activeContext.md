# Active Context

## Current Focus

We have completed three major implementations for the NBA stat projections application:

1. A comprehensive notifications system including:
   - Database schema and API endpoints for notifications
   - UI components for displaying and managing notifications
   - Real-time notification delivery through WebSockets
   - User preferences for notification settings
   - Notification triggers for key events
   - Email notification delivery options

2. Database performance optimization including:
   - Comprehensive query performance monitoring and logging
   - Materialized views for frequently accessed data
   - Optimized indexes for all major entities
   - Query caching system for repetitive requests
   - Automatic scheduled refresh of materialized views
   - Database connection pooling for improved throughput

3. CDN integration for static assets:
   - Cloudflare CDN configured for static asset delivery
   - Custom image loader for Cloudflare Image Resizing
   - Optimal cache headers for different asset types
   - CDN verification and analysis tools
   - Deployment workflow for Cloudflare Pages
   - Cache rules configured for different asset types

## Next Steps

With these systems now complete, we can focus on the next priorities:
- Enhancing the mobile experience
- Adding enhanced data visualization for player statistics
- Completing end-to-end testing

## Recent Changes

- Implemented CDN integration with Cloudflare
- Created custom image loader for optimized image delivery
- Set up comprehensive cache configuration for different asset types
- Developed CDN verification and analysis tools
- Created deployment workflow for Cloudflare Pages

- Modified notification controller to respect user email preferences

## Technical Decisions

### Notifications System
- Using browser notifications API for desktop notifications
- Notification sounds are played using the Web Audio API
- Email notifications use HTML templates with responsive design
- Notification digests group notifications by type for better organization
- Email delivery leverages existing SMTP configuration
- Game status changes are detected by comparing previous and current game states
- Player milestones are detected by comparing previous and current stats
- Projection updates are only notified if they exceed a certain threshold percentage

### Database Optimization
- Using materialized views for common queries that are expensive to compute
- Implementing comprehensive indexing strategy with regular, composite, and partial indexes
- Using trigram indexing for fuzzy text search capabilities
- Performance logging tracks slow queries and provides analytics
- Automatic scheduled refresh keeps materialized views up-to-date
- Query caching reduces database load for repetitive requests
- Database connection pooling improves throughput for multiple concurrent users

### CDN Integration
- Selected Cloudflare as the CDN provider for its comprehensive feature set and global presence
- Using custom image loader to leverage Cloudflare's Image Resizing service
- Implementing different caching strategies based on asset type
- Configuring long cache TTLs for static assets with versioning for updates
- Using Cloudflare Pages for simplified deployment and edge distribution
- Implemented verification tools to ensure proper CDN configuration

## Open Questions

- How should we handle subscription-based features?
- What analytics should we track for user engagement?
- How can we best optimize the mobile experience?
- Should we implement a custom admin panel or use Supabase dashboard?
- What additional user preferences should we offer?
