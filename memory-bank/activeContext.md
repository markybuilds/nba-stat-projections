2. UI components for displaying and managing notifications
3. Real-time notification delivery through WebSockets
4. User preferences for notification settings (types, sounds, desktop notifications)
5. Notification triggers for key events:
   - Game start/end notifications
   - Player milestone notifications (points, rebounds, assists, double-doubles, triple-doubles)
   - Significant projection update notifications (when projections change by a threshold %)
   - Favorite team game notifications
   - League event notifications
6. Email notification delivery options:
   - Immediate email notifications for specific notification types
   - Digest mode for batched notifications (daily/weekly)
   - User preferences for email notification settings

## Next Steps
