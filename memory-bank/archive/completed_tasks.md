## Email Notification Delivery Option Implementation

**Date:** April 9, 2024

### Overview
We successfully implemented a comprehensive email notification delivery system that allows users to receive notifications via email based on their preferences. The system supports both immediate notifications and digest mode for batched delivery.

### Components Implemented

1. **Email Notification Service**
   - Created `notification_email_service.py` for sending individual notification emails
   - Implemented HTML templating for attractive, responsive emails
   - Added SMTP configuration integration with environment variables
   - Implemented logging for tracking email delivery status

2. **Notification Digest Service**
   - Created `notification_digest_service.py` for sending batched notifications
   - Implemented daily and weekly digest options
   - Added mechanisms to collect pending notifications and format them into digest emails
   - Added functions to mark notifications as read after sending digests

3. **Database Updates**
   - Added migration `add_email_notification_settings.sql` with new user preference fields:
     - `email_notification_types`: JSONB field for controlling which types get emailed
     - `email_notification_digest`: Boolean to enable/disable digest mode
     - `email_notification_schedule`: Text field for specifying digest schedule
   - Added helper functions for fetching users and their notifications for digests

4. **Scheduler Configuration**
   - Updated `scheduler_service.py` to include digest-specific scheduling methods
   - Added `schedule_notification_digests()` method to schedule both daily and weekly digests
   - Updated application startup in `main.py` to initialize digest schedulers

5. **User Preferences UI**
   - Enhanced `user-preferences.tsx` with email notification settings
   - Added toggles for individual notification types
   - Implemented digest mode selection with schedule options
   - Created UI conditional logic to show/hide relevant settings

6. **Notification Controller Updates**
   - Updated `notification_controller.py` to respect user email preferences
   - Added logic to check notification type against user preferences
   - Implemented conditional email sending based on digest settings

### Technical Decisions

- Used HTML email templates with responsive design for better user experience
- Implemented grouped notifications by type in digest emails for better organization
- Created a singleton pattern for both email services to ensure efficient resource usage
- Used database functions to optimize user and notification queries for digests
- Leveraged the scheduler service for reliable, configurable digest delivery
- Added comprehensive logging for troubleshooting email delivery issues

### User Experience

- Users can now choose which notification types to receive via email
- Users can opt for digests to reduce email frequency
- Email notifications match the styling and information of in-app notifications
- Both immediate and digest emails include actionable links to relevant content

### Future Improvements

- Add click tracking for email notifications
- Implement more sophisticated email templates with better branding
- Add email unsubscribe links for easier preference management
- Create an email preview feature in user preferences
